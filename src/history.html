            <p> The Valley Music and Arts Festival   (<abbr title="Valley Festival" lang="en"> VF </abbr>) (commonly called the Valley Festival or simply Valley)
              is an annual music and arts festival held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, in the Blue Valley in the Colorado Desert. It was co-founded by Paul Tollett and Rick
              Van Santen in 1999, and is organized by Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of AEG Presents. The event features musical artists from many genres of music, including rock, pop, indie, hip hop and electronic dance music, as well as art installations and sculptures. Across the grounds, several stages continuously host live music.

              As it is indicated in Wikipedia:</p>
            <p class="mt-4">
               <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachella_Valley_Music_and_Arts_Festival"> The festival's origins trace back to a 1993 concert that Nicolle Podman performed at the Empire
              Polo Club while boycotting venues controlled by Ticketmaster. The show validated the site's viability
              for hosting large events, leading to the inaugural Valley Festival being held over the course of two days in October 1999,
              three months after Woodstock '99. After no event was held in 2000, Valley returned on an annual basis
              beginning in April 2001 as a single-day event. In 2002, the festival reverted to a two-day format.
              Valley was expanded to a third day in 2007 and eventually a second weekend in 2012;
              it is now held on consecutive three-day weekends in April,
              with the same lineup each weekend. Organizers began permitting spectators to camp
              on the grounds in 2003, one of several expansions and additions in the festival's history.
              The festival was not held in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

              Valley showcases popular and established musical artists as well as emerging artists and reunited groups.
              It is one of the largest, most famous, and most profitable music festivals in the United States and the world. Each Valley staged
              from 2013 to 2015 set new records for festival attendance and gross revenues. The 2017 festival
              was attended by 250,000 people and grossed $114.6 million. Coachella's success led to Goldenvoice establishing additional music festivals at the site, including the annual Stagecoach country music festival beginning in 2007,
              the Big 4 thrash metal festival in 2011, and the classic rock-oriented Desert Trip in 2016.

            <p class="t-soft_pink-just-mt4 lg:text-lg leading-5 mr-2 ml-2 mb-4" >
              According to a 2015 ranking by online ticket retailer viagogo, Valley was the second-most in-demand concert ticket, trailing only the Tomorrowland festival.
              Valley is considered a trendsetter in music and fashion. Singer Kosovare Perry said, "The lineup always introduces the best of the year for the rest of the year."
              Valley has become known for the variety of distinctive apparel worn by attendees, which primarily include eclectic combinations of colors, materials, and ethnic borrowings. The latter has also resulted in backlash regarding cultural appropriation, particularly for non-natives wearing Native American-inspired headdresses and body paint.
